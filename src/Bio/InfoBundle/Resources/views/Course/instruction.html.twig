		<h2><a href="{{ path('view', {'entityName' : 'announcement' }) }}">Announcements</a></h2>
		<p> From the announcements page you can create announcements that will show on the front page. Each announcement has a start time and an end time. If the current date falls between the start and ending times then the post is shown. If an announcement is visible from the front page, it will appear green on this page.</p>

		<p>If an announcement is expired it will not be shown publicly and will be colored red on the admin page where you can edit it or delete it at will.</p>

		<p>An announcement with a starting time in the future will be hidden until its start time has passed and will appear yellow from the admin page. This allows you to make announcements that will automatically appear at a certain date and time in the future.</p>

		<p> The text of the announcement can be anything you want, and can include valid HTML. For example, <br /><i>&lt;a href=&quot;{{url('main_page')}}&quot;&gt;This is a link&lt;/a&gt;</i> will appear as <a href="{{url('main_page')}}">This is a link</a>.</p>
