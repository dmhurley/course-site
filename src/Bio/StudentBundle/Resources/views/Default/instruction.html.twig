		<h2><a href="{{ path('find_student') }}">Find</a></h2>
		<p> If you wish to find a certain student among the list, or perhaps view all students in a section. The find page will allow you to do so. From this page you can search by any combination of fields, and additionally edit, delete, and sort from the displayed list. You can view a list of all students by not filling in any fields, but with large classes this will be a slow process.</p>

		<h2><a href="{{ path('add_student') }}">Add</a></h2>
		<p> The add page lets you add students to the list for testing or temporary purposes. Keep in mind that any changes here will not be reflected in the official list. </p>

		<h2><a href="{{ path('upload_student') }}">Upload</a></h2>
		<p> From here you can upload <i>.csv</i> files from the registrars office. This will only work if the file is properly formatted. Keep in mind that uploading a list will completely overwrite any changes you have made.</p>
